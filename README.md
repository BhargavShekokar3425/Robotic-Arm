# Robotic Arm Control using Voice Commands

![Robotic Arm Banner](https://example.com/your-visual.png) <!-- Replace with your image URL -->

## Overview

This project is designed to control a **robotic arm** using voice commands. It utilizes the **pyFirmata** library to interface with an Arduino and control the servo motors attached to various joints of the robotic arm. Speech recognition is handled using the **SpeechRecognition** library, and text-to-speech is managed by **pyttsx3**.
